# The Rain Warden

This is a game being developed for a final project for a high school level Computer Science Course.

In The Rain Warden, you play as Lila, a seemingly ordinary girl who was gifted a pendant when she was young. She was told many times that she would fulfil a prophecy, but she never believed it, until one day when the pendant started to glow and gave her powers. As she adventured, she came across a village that was cursed with eternal rain. It is up to her to put an end to the rain and save the village.

# Controls
Use WASD to move.

Press space to jump.

Press space after jumping to perform a double jump.

Later in the game, Lila is granted the power of dashing. Use shift to dash.

Lila also comes across strong wind currents while adventuring in the mountains. Hold E to use her umbrella to ride the wind currents.

# Collectibles
While adventuring, Lila comes across a few different objects that she can collect. Mangos are purely for show, as they are often in difficult to reach locations. However, there is a special object that she can pick up called a Shiny Raindrop. Shiny Raindrops reimbue power into her pendant after it has already been used. In other words, picking up a Shiny Raindrop allows Lila to perform an extra dash in the air.
